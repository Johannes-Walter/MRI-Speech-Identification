<h1> Speech detection of real-time MRI vocal tract data </h1>

In this project, <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/A_multispeaker_dataset_of_raw_and_reconstructed_speech_production_real-time_MRI_video_and_3D_volumetric_images/13725546/1">real-time MRI data</a> was applied to recognize spoken letters from tongue movements using a vector-based image detection approach. In addition, to generate more data randomization was applied by minimally rotating the vectors. The pixel vectors of a video clip during which a certain letter was spoken could then be passed into a Deep Learning model. For this purpose, the neural networks LSTM and 3D-CNN were used and studied for their performance.
